        See if you can write a function for yourself. We want to write a function that adds
        two numbers.

        1. Create a function that takes two parameters, adds the parameters together,
        and returns the result.

        2. Set up two different variables with two different values.

        3. Use your function on the two variables, and output the result using
        console.log.

        4. Create a second call to the function using two more numbers as arguments
        sent to the function.

        We are going to create a program that will randomly describe an inputted name.

        1. Create an array of descriptive words.

        2. Create a function that contains a prompt asking the user for a name.

        3. Select a random value from the array using Math.random.

        4. Output into the console the prompt value and the randomly selected array
        value.

        5. Invoke the function.

        Create a basic calculator that takes two numbers and one string value indicating
        an operation. If the operation equals add, the two numbers should be added. If the
        operation equals subtract, the two numbers should be subtracted from one another.
        If there is no option specified, the value of the option should be add.
        The result of this function needs to be logged. Test your function by invoking it 
        with different operators and no operator specified.

        1. Set up two variables containing number values.

        2. Set up a variable to hold an operator, either + or -.

        3. Create a function that retrieves the two values and the operator string value
        within its parameters. Use those values with a condition to check if the
        operator is + or -, and add or subtract the values accordingly (remember if
        not presented with a valid operator, the function should default to addition).

        4. Within console.log(), call the function using your variables and output
        the response to the console.

        5. Update the operator value to be the other operator type—either plus or
        minus—and call to the function again with the new updated arguments.

        Modify the calculator that you made in Practice exercise 6.2 to return added values
        instead of printing them. Then, call the function 10 or more times in a loop, and store 
        the results in an array. Once the loop finishes, output the final array into the console.

        1. Set up an empty array to store the values that will be calculated within the
        loop.

        2. Create a loop that runs 10 times, incrementing by 1 each time, creating two
        values each iteration. For the first value, multiply the value of the loop count
        by 5. For the second value, multiply the value of the loop counter by itself.

        3. Create a function that returns the value of the two parameters passed into the
        function when it is called. Add the values together, returning the result.

        4. Within the loop, call the calculation function, passing in the two values as
        arguments into the function and storing the returned result in a response
        variable.

        5. Still within the loop, push the result values into the array as it iterates
        through the loop.

        6. After the loop is complete, output the value of the array into the console.

        7. You should see the values [0, 6, 14, 24, 36, 50, 66, 84, 104, 126] for
        the array in the console.

        Use IIFE to create a few immediately invoked functions and observe how the scope is
        affected.

       1. Create a variable value with let and assign a string value of 1000 to it.

       2. Create an IIFE function and within this function scope assign a new value to
       a variable of the same name. Within the function, print the local value to the
       console. 

       3. Create an IIFE expression, assigning it to a new result variable, and assign
       a new value to a variable of the same name within this scope. Return this
       local value to the result variable and invoke the function. Print the result
       variable, along with the variable name you've been using: what value does it
       contain now?

       4. Lastly, create an anonymous function that has a parameter. Add logic tha t
       will assign a passed-in value to the same variable name as the other steps,
       and print it as part of a string sentence. Invoke the function and pass in your
       desired value within the rounded brackets.

        1. Create a function that contains a condition within it checking if the argument
        value is 0.

        2. If the parameter is equal to 0, it should return the value of 1. Otherwise, it
        should return the value of the argument multiplied by the value returned
        from the function itself, subtracting one from the value of the argument
        that is provided. This will result in running the block of code until the value
        reaches 0.

        3. Invoke the function, providing an argument of whatever number you want
        to find the factorial of. The code should run whatever number is passed
        initially into the function, decreasing all the way to 0 and outputting the
        results of the calculation to the console. It could also contain a console.log()
        call to print the current value of the argument in the function as it gets
        invoked.

        4. Change and update the number to see how it affects the results.

        Create a countdown loop starting at a dynamic value of 10.

        1. Set the start variable at a value of 10, which will be used as the starting
        value for the loop.

        2. Create a function that takes one argument, which is the countdown value.

        3. Within the function, output the current value of the countdown into the
        console.

        4. Add a condition to check if the value is less than 1; if it is, then return the
        function.

        5. Add a condition to check if the value of the countdown is not less than 1,
        then continue to loop by calling the function within itself.

        6. Make sure you add a decrement operator on the countdown so the preceding
        condition eventually will be true to end the loop. Every time it loops, the
        value will decrease until it reaches 0.

        7. Update and create a second countdown using a condition if the value is
        greater than 0. If it is, decrease the value of the countdown by 1.

        8. Use return to return the function, which then invokes it again and again
        until the condition is no longer true.

        9. Make sure, when you send the new countdown value as an argument into
        the function, that there is a way out of the loop by using the return keyword
        and a condition that continues the loop if met.

        Use the arrow format to create functions that output the values one and two to the
        console. Create a third function that outputs the value three to the console, and then
        invokes the first two functions.
        Create a fourth function that outputs the word four to the console and also use
        setTimeout() to invoke the first function immediately and then the third function.
        What does your output look like in the console? Try to get the console to output:
